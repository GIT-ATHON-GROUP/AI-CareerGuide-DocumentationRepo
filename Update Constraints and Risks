## 8. CONSTRAINTS AND RISKS
### 8.1. Constraints
- **Data Availability:** The accuracy of career recommendations will depend on the quality and quantity of data available for various career options.
  
- **Algorithm Complexity:** The balance of clustering and classification algorithms with real-time performance can be a challenge.
  
- **Limited learning:** The A.I. Career Guide's ability to learn can be limited by the scope of data it's trained on and may not immediately capture changing 
job market trends.

- **Interpersonal Evaluation:** Assessing interpersonal skills accurately through algorithms can be complex, as some skills require careful consideration to 
fully understand.

- **Budget:** The hardware required for the development of the system may be costly.
  
- **Time:** The Chabot is a complicated system and requires a long time to be able to function best.
  
### 8.2. Risks
- **Inaccurate recommendations:** If the clustering and classification algorithms are not properly trained, the software could provide irrelevant career 
suggestions.

- **Bias:** The A.I. Career Guide could favour certain career options due to biased training data, which could lead to unfair recommendations.
  
- **Lack of user engagement:** If the recommendations are not accurate, learners might not find the software useful, which will lead to a low adoption rate.
  
- **Market Changes:** Changes in the job market due to technological advancement or economic changes might cause the software to give less relevant recommendations.
  
- **Security:** If the system is not properly secured, it could be hacked and give out false information or engage in malicious activities.
