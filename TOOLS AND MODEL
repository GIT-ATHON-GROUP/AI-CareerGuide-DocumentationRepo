10. **MODEL**
- Our system will use the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for optimum performance and also to understand and interact with users.

- Collecting and Preparing Data: Compile a dataset that is relevant to educational pathways, job descriptions and user queries.

- Text classification for user intents: Label user query categories and train the model to recognise the learner's intents.

- Text Generation for Responses: Use ruled-based responses to ensure that responses are informative, concise, and contextually relevant.

- User Texting and Evaluation: Test the chatbot with real users to gather feedback and evaluate the chatbotâ€™s performance to identify areas for improvement.

- Personalisation: The User data will be learned to personalise the required and close-range response. This will be considered using past events, searches and future interactions.
